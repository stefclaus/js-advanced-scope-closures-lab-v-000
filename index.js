produceDrivingRange(){

}

// Calculates whether a given trip is within range. For example,
//produceDrivingRange(10) returns a function that will take two strings as
//arguments and returns a message stating whether the trip is in range. If foo =
// produceDrivingRange(10), then foo('12th', '15th') would return "within range by
// 7" and foo('12th', '30th') would return "8 blocks out of range". We recommend
//referencing the test/indexTest.js for more details.


function produceTipCalculator(tipPercentage){
  return function(tipAmount) {
    return tipAmount * tipPercentage;
  };
}


//produceTipCalculator() - Returns a function that then calculates a tip.
//For example, produceTipCalculator(.10) returns a function that calculates
//ten percent tip on a fare. produceTipCalculator(.20) returns a function that
//calculates twenty percent tip on a fare.

createDriver(){

}
//createDriver is a function that returns a Driver class. The class has reference
//to a driverId that is incremented each time a new driver is created. The rest
//of the code base does not have access to driverId.
